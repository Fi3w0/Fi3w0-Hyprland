# Fi3w0-Hyprland

This is **my personal Arch Linux + Hyprland configuration**.  
The main purpose of this repository is to **backup my system**, because honestly, I’m still learning to use Linux.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
You’re free to browse or experiment with these dotfiles, but I don’t recommend using them on your system directly—they’re tailored to my setup and may break yours.

---

## What’s inside?
- Hyprland configuration files
- Waybar, Rofi, Fish shell setups
- Wallpapers and assets
- Random experimental tweaks
- Some themes scripts for Nvim or Waybar

---

## Usage

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fi3w0/Fi3w0-Hyprland.git

Then copy the configuration files to your user config directory (~/.config/) so they are picked up by your system:

cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/hyprland ~/.config/
cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/waybar ~/.config/
cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/rofi ~/.config/
cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/fish ~/.config/
cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/nvim ~/.config/
cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/Wallpapers ~/home/
cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/.icons ~/home/

For assets, copy them to your Pictures or config folder (or just delete):

mkdir -p ~/Pictures
cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/assets ~/.config/

    ⚠️ Important: These configuration files are specifically tailored for my system and setup.
    You may need to adjust paths, keybindings, or other settings to make them work properly on your own system.

- (There is no Fastfetch config but you can look it here this is the one I use [Fastfetch cli](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch))

- (SwayNC is working 50/50 so you may not use it if you don't care that much about Notification centre)
