# Fi3w0-Hyprland

This is **my personal Arch Linux + Hyprland configuration**.  
The main purpose of this repository is to **backup my system**, because honestly, I’m like a monkey with an AWP in space when it comes to making thing work without errors.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
You’re free to browse or experiment with these dotfiles, but I don’t recommend using them on your system directly—they’re tailored to my setup and may break yours.

---

## What’s inside?
- Hyprland configuration files
- Waybar, Rofi, Fish shell setups
- Wallpapers and assets
- Random experimental tweaks

---

## Usage
Clone the repo if you really want, but carefully:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fi3w0/Fi3w0-Hyprland.git

Copy files to your configuration folder (example):

cp -r Fi3w0-Hyprland/* ~/.config/
```
AND DO NOT FOLDER TO CHANGE CONFIG FILES LOCATIONS SO ALL WORKS FINE RIGHT NOW THERE IS MY LOCATIONS BUT YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT.

Here’s a quick glance at the main applications I use in this setup:
