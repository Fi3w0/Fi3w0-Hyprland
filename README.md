# Fi3w0-Hyrpland

This is **my personal Arch Linux + Hyprland config**.  
The main purpose of this repo is just to **backup my system** — because honestly, I’m like a monkey with an AWP in space when it comes to configs.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
You’re free to look at or use these dotfiles, but I don’t recommend it. They’re made for my setup and may break yours.
